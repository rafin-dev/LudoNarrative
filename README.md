Game engine for windows made with Directx.

I am following [TheCherno's Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) for the basics of Engine design as I have no prior experience of my own. 

**This is not a direct copy of Hazel 2D**, I will be using the series as a guide on what is needed for an engine and an example of its implementation, and I'll go out of my way to make the changes that better suit my preferrable design and objective, the biggest one being the use of Directx instead of OpenGL.

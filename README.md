Game engine for windows made with Directx.

I am following [TheCherno's Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) for the basics of Engine design as I have no prior experience of my own. 

LudoNarrative is a game engine made for Windows x64, there are no current plans for support any other platforms

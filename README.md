# LudoNarrative Game Engine

Game engine for windows made with Directx.

LudoNarrative is a game engine made for Windows x64, there are no current plans for support any other platforms.

## How to build

This part will not be complete until a official Github Release comes out.

## Learning Resources used:

- [TheCherno's Game Engine Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) for the basics of Engine design as I have no prior experience of my own.

- [LÃ¶twig Fusel's D3D12Ez Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL-m4pn2uJvXF30Vu2DNK1mKH2EJxOc_jU) to learn about and how to use DirectX12 for Rendering. I ended moving
to D3D11 for the sake of simplicity, but since I started on D3D12 using this series, I feel like it should be mentioned here.
